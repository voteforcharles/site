              My family and I have lived in Palos Verdes Estates for 25 years
              and have enjoyed its natural beauty as well as seen some of its
              unique challenges. There are various neighborhoods within PVE,
              each with their own unique characteristics. As a member of the
              Board, I want to preserve the natural qualities that make PVE such
              a wonderful place to live. The protective restrictions and
              standards are essential in accomplishing this mission.

              PVE and the Miraleste area of RPV will face many challenges in the
              future, some even mandated by the state. As a Director of the
              PVHA, my responsibility is to be accountable to all the homeowners
              and look out for your interests. I believe the business of the
              PVHA should be conducted with integrity in a strategic and
              transparent manner. Policies should be developed and implemented
              in an open, fair, and collaborative manner. My extensive
              experience in working with non-profit organizations, commercial
              entities, and governmental agencies will enable me to be
              successful in addressing the complex issues of our community.

            <p>
              My family and I have been residents of Palos Verdes Estates since
              1995. After a successful 35 year career at The Aerospace
              Corporation, I became a serial entrepreneur and created several
              companies including a technology venture capital firm, a real
              estate investment company, and a nonprofit educational company to
              help disadvantaged people become financially literate. In
              addition, I continue to teach system architectures, technology
              startups, and managing engineering innovation at Loyola Marymount
              University and the University of Southern California.
            </p>
            <p>
              My educational background includes a MBA from Pepperdine
              University and PhD/MS/BS degrees in electrical engineering from
              the University of Southern California. All three of my grown
              children attended PV schools from Lunada Bay elementary to PV High
              and Peninsula High.
            </p>

              In my spare time, I enjoy working on and riding my cars and
              motorcycles. My family and I love Palos Verdes Estates and I am
              looking forward to ensuring that the beauty and unique quality of
              life in Palos Verdes will endure for the enjoyment of future
              generations.
