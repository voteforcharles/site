        <h3>Position</h3>
        <p>My family and I have lived in Palos Verdes Estates for 25 years and have enjoyed its natural beauty as well as seen some of its unique challenges. There are various neighborhoods within PVE, each with their own unique characteristics. As a member of the Board, I want to preserve the natural qualities that make PVE such a wonderful place to live. The protective restrictions and standards are essential in accomplishing this mission.</p>
        <p>PVE and the Miraleste area of RPV will face many challenges in the future, some even mandated by the state. As a Director of the PVHA, my responsibility is to be accountable to all the homeowners and look out for your interests. I believe the business of the PVHA should be conducted with integrity in a strategic and transparent manner. Policies should be developed and implemented in an open, fair, and collaborative manner. My extensive experience in working with non-profit organizations, commercial entities, and governmental agencies will enable me to be successful in addressing the complex issues of our community.</p>

        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>My family and I have been residents of Palos Verdes Estates since 1995. After a successful 35 year career at The Aerospace Corporation, I became a serial entrepreneur and created several companies including a technology venture capital firm, a real estate investment company, and a nonprofit educational company to help disadvantaged people become financially literate. In addition, I continue to teach system architectures, technology startups, and managing engineering innovation at Loyola Marymount University and the University of Southern California.</p>
        <p>My educational background includes a MBA from Pepperdine University and PhD/MS/BS degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California. All three of my grown children attended PV schools from Lunada Bay elementary to PV High and Peninsula High.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy working on and riding my cars and motorcycles. My family and I love Palos Verdes Estates and I am looking forward to ensuring that the beauty and unique quality of life in Palos Verdes will endure for the enjoyment of future generations.</p>
